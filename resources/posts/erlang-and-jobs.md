People in my line of work (writing distributed, network applications)
seem to be afraid of [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/doc/
"Erlang").

Several reasons, I think:

  * **Developers**

    Something new to learn, and thus they feel that they're at a
    disadvantage, or won't be able to contribute or they'll acquire a
    skill with no value on the job market.

  * **Managers**

    Worried that they won't be able to find developers to work on the
    code base once the original authors leave, and fear that any new
    technology is just as bad as the last few "hacks" they graciously
    allowed to invade the architecture (except Java, which is somehow
    always the right thing).

The strange thing is, I see people all over the place who want to work
with Erlang (or Python or Ruby or Scheme or Lisp or Smalltalk), not so
much because Erlang is a cool language, but because it solves so many
of the problems they have to deal with day in and day out. And it's a
cool language.

The whole thing strikes me as a destructive, self-fulfilling
prophecy. We won't invest in the small amount of time it takes to
learn the language because we don't see that there are potential
employees out there to be hired if we need them. And there aren't any
potential employees because no one will let anyone use Erlang for
production projects.

A Catch-22, to be sure.

What distresses me is that, deep down, such decisions aren't
rational. They're based on fear. Fear of change, and fear that one's
employees might be necessary to one's success, rather than being
discardable, fungible assets. One could claim that choosing Erlang in
itself is emotional, and I'd tend to agree, but it's a positive
emotion: pleasure at being able to solve problems more easily,
pleasure learning something new, pleasure at opening up the possible
range of solutions for any given problem. If one makes a decision on
emotional grounds, these are the right emotions.


What also distresses me is that I don't believe hiring managers know
anything at all about who they need to hire, and the skills they need,
and thus fall back on the notion that expertise in a set of platform
tools means anything at all. (A man who can wield a hammer with the
best of them may or may not be good at building cabinets.)


Right now, when I see job positions asking for candidates well-versed
in Java, J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, Inversion-of-Control, and so on, I
see a shop in which very little gets done over a long period of time,
a process-bound[^ag], over hierarchicalized, overly large team: the
[mythical man month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
incarnate. I see a recipe for failure.

[^ag]: And I count Agile here.

Like the lumbering empires of old, the appearance of strength and
stability hides a vast and empty core.
