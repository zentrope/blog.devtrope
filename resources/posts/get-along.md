The software is not your software. The product is not your
product. The business is not your business. The process is not meant
to make you more effective. You have no part in managing the
project. No one is asking for help. Being more effective is not the
point. Your ability to execute is not the point.

Never speak in a meeting unless asked a direct question. Don't respond
to "does the team" questions. If people say factually incorrect
things, let them.

The politics and process of managing the project is more important
than the outcome of the project. Do not forget that.

Politics is the main focus of the business. A pawn does not
challenge. A pawn does not clarify or restate. A pawn does not call
attention to victories or failures. A pawn does not disturb. A pawn's
purpose is to be present at the designated time and place and to
appear cheerful.

No one cares about your opinion. Asking for it is a technique to make
you feel valued. You are not.

Don't socialize with colleagues. Don't talk about work. Change
the subject.

If a colleague wants to collaborate, do so. Do not initiate
collaboration. Email if not doing so causes you to fail. Do not
communicate if you can still work.

Do not respond to email containing questions "does the team?" or "does
anyone?" Do not respond to email containing interesting assertions
about fun stuff or jokes or the state of the project. Do not send
email unless required by convention or unless it's to a specific
person with a specific question the answer to which is critical to
your work. Do not send interesting links.

Do not use chat.

When criticized in one-on-ones, ask for evidence. Remain silent unless
asked a direct question. If not criticized, say, "I have nothing to
talk about with regard to the team or the business".

Turn off business email when out of the building. Turn off the company
calender when out of the building. Take the stairs rather than the
elevator. Wear headphones as much as possible. Do not keep personal
items on or near your desk. Do not keep anything personal on your work
computer. Do not eat lunch with others. Do not attend optional
meetings. Do not engage in small talk. Do engage in conversations
about craft, theory, process, past mistakes, past victories, past
jobs, past relationships, future prospects. Do not talk.

Do not talk.
