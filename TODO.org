* Plans

The basic plan with this re-write is to simplify the entire system
down to a bare minimum. I'm also going to assume that the posts are
stored with the code, so no separation of app from data anymore.

 - [X] Store posts in resources directory
 - [X] Store pages in the resources directory.
 - [X] Pages and posts have :type metadata as first line.
 - [ ] Revise post metadata (shorten, iso 8601 dates, etc).
 - [ ] Read in and properly sort files.
 - [ ] HTML is generated with Hiccup (no templates).
 - [ ] Generate index page (first page of site).
 - [ ] Generate post pages (main content).
 - [ ] Non-post pages are sections at bottom of index.
 - [ ] CSS style with fixed header footer.
 - [ ] Allow org-mode posts.

That about does it, I think.
