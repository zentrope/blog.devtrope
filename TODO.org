* Plans

The basic plan with this re-write is to simplify the entire system
down to a bare minimum. I'm also going to assume that the posts are
stored with the code, so no separation of app from data anymore.

** Before re-publication

 - [X] Store posts in resources directory
 - [X] Store pages in the resources directory.
 - [X] Pages and posts have :type metadata as first line.
 - [X] Revise post metadata (shorten, iso 8601 dates, etc).
 - [X] Read in and properly sort files.
 - [X] HTML is generated with Hiccup (no templates).
 - [X] Generate index page (first page of site).
 - [X] Generate post pages (main content).
 - [X] Non-post pages are sections at bottom of index.
 - [X] CSS style with fixed header footer.
 - [X] Script/css style management.
 - [X] Nice garamond-like web font of some sort.
 - [X] Image asset management.
 - [ ] RSS feed generation.
 - [ ] Final fixes (for first pub).

** After re-publication

 - [X] Responsive design.
 - [ ] Allow org-mode posts.

That about does it, I think.
